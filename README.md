A fun little toy game for kids to learn programming with: the turtle language!

Users write programs out of following commands (one command per line), telling
a turtle how to walk over the screen:

* `right n`
	* Moves the turtle to the right by `n` steps.
- `left n`
	- Moves the turtle to the left by `n` steps.
* `down n`
	* Moves the turtle down by `n` steps.
- `up n`
	- Moves the turtle up by `n` steps.
* `diagonal x y`
	* Moves the turtle to the specified coordinates on the board without
	  leaving a trail.
